Review the listing carefully to ensure the property will suit your needs and be sure to ask the host any questions you may have. We recommend messaging a variety of hosts to secure a reservation more efficiently.\n\n2. Once the host confirms availability, click on \U201cBook It\U201d from the listing page. You book through the site in full and up-front using your credit card or PayPal account. This allows us to provide you customer service before, during and after your trip and also allows you to cancel in line with the host's cancellation policy.\n\n3. When your host accepts the reservation request, you will receive a confirmation email with their direct contact information. Be sure to go over the details of your reservation prior to your arrival.\n\n4. Your payment will not be released until 24 hours after you check in to your accommodation. That means that if you encounter any problems upon arrival, contact Makent support and we will be happy to assist you. Please note: The only way you become unprotected by Makent is if you were to complete a transaction outside of our website.";

In the event that a host and traveler have negotiated a different price than what is advertised on the listing page, a host can make the guest a Special Offer via the messaging system on the site. To do so, open the message thread with the traveler and click on the drop-down that says \"click for other actions\", which is located below the blank message box. From the drop-down, select \"Make Special Offer\".\n\nIn the Special Offer field that then appears, specify which property is being offered, the start date of the guest's stay, the number of nights and number of guests, and the total cost of the entire reservation. Don't forget, the total cost should be the price for the entire stay, not the price per night. Once these fields have been filled out, a short message can be included if need. After these fields have been completed, click on \"Post Response\".\n\nFor this offered price to be processed in the reservation, the guest must book by clicking on \"Book Using Special Offer\", which appears at the bottom of the Special Offer message. If the guest books the Special Offer within 24 hours after it has been offered, the reservation will immediately be processed as accepted. If more than a 24 hour time period has elapsed, the host will receive a reservation request, which then needs to be accepted or denied.";

To set this up, go to your Dashboard > Account > Payout Preferences > Add Payout Method and follow the instructions.\n\nYour payment will be released to you 24 hours after the guest checks in.

Additionally, you will need to officially cancel the reservation through the site. In order to do so, go to your Dashboard > Hosting > My Reservations and under the Details section > Cancel Reservation.\n\nIn order to discourage cancellations, there are some penalties. If you cancel once, the penalty should not significantly impact you. However if you cancel too many times, the penalty will significantly impact the amount of business that you can do on Makent.com. The penalties are:\n\n1. Your position/rank on the search results page will decrease.\n2. A review will appear on your property indicating that this reservation was canceled.\n3. The calendar will remain blocked for the dates of this reservation.\n4. If you cancel more than one reservation within a six month period, a one-time fee will be deducted from your next payout. For this cancellation there will be no fee.";
